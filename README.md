## Tridiagonal matrix algorithm (Thomas algorithm)
The initial system of linear equations has the form:

c_{i}x_{i-1} + d_{i}*x{i} + e_{i}*x{i+1} = f_{i}, where i=2,...,n-1 

Source files: input1,inpu2,input3
Files result: result1, result2, result3
To skip the program, you need to write `make`
And then write `./main`
